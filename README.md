The `NLP` class provides a simple command-line interface for accessing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Sentiment Analysis, and Emotion Prediction. This interactive program allows users to register, log in, and utilize NLP services on text data.

## Features

- User registration and login functionality to access NLP services.
- Three NLP tasks are available:
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identify entities (e.g., names, locations, organizations) in text.
  - Sentiment Analysis: Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of text.
  - Emotion Prediction: Predict emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry) associated with text.
- User-friendly menu-driven interface for easy interaction.
